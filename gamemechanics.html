							<p>
								The core game play in Peblo will be a 
								<b>mix of puzzle solving and fighting monsters</b>,
								both of which serve your progress in the game.
						</section>
						<section class="docs-section" id="item-1-1">
							<i>Fighting</i> - The fighting in Peblo, will be <b>slow and precise</b>. Rather then button
							mashing,
							Peblo should be precise and smart in defeating enemies. This means utilising his
							<b>surroundings
								and umbrella</b> in order to destroy the enemies using timing and tactics.
							<br><br>
							I want players to pick their fights, rather then be inclined to fight every monsters.
							<b>They should make a calculated decision, and weigh up whether its worth it. </b>
							<br><br>
						</section>
						<section class="docs-section" id="item-1-2">
							<i>Puzzles</i> – The Puzzles in Peblo, will be <b>difficult</b>. I want a game which truly
							causes you to think,
							kind of like a dark souls of puzzles. Rather then being spoon fed the answer, players should
							feel
							very rewarded for coming up with a solution.
							<br><br>
							That is why its crucial that every puzzle is solvable from the get go, with a variety of
							solutions.
							<br><br>
							Its crucial to make the world itself a puzzle, the story of the world should be a puzzle in
							itself.
							Being solved by the narrative and by the puzzles within the game. 
							<b>Solving the puzzle of the world, will lead you to the end game. Rather then following a sequential pattern</b>.

						<h2 class="section-heading">Game Flow</h2>
						<br>
						<h3> Macroflow </h3>
						<p>
							The macroflow is a progression of the challenge that adapted to the player’s skills.
							It is also known and related to the difficulty curve.
							<br><br>
							The goal of the macroflow is to maintain the player in the zone between anxiety and boredom.
							For a game designer point of view, it means managing;
						</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>
							<b>Learning Curve</b>
							<br><br>
							Peblo's learning curve is linear. 
							The learning curve, is dependant on new monsters, puzzles and player controls.
							The learning curve increases depending on the following factors:
							<br><br>
							<ul>
								<li>
								<b>PHYSICAL SKILLS:</b>
								<br>
								We can define the physical skills by the way the player interacts with a game controller or interact with the surface of a phone or a tablet. Those player’s skills are used in action game or arcade style game.
								<ul>
								<li>Measurement - Player must control his action using the amplitude of his movement and the level of pressure on the tumbstick/pad/buttons/stylus</li>
								<li>Precision - Player must provide an accurate and precise input</li>
								<li>Reflexes - The player must react to an unpredicatable stimulus and provide appropriate input at the right time</li>
								<li>Timing - Player must anticipate the right moment to provide an input</li>
								<li>Endurance - The player must keep doing the same action and must resist to tiredness of doing it.</li>
								</ul>
								</li>
								<br><br>
								<li>
								<b>MENTAL SKILLS:</b>
								<br>
								Mental skills were defined by the one that the player use his brain for the input. Those player’s skills are the most abstracted one and are hard to define and understand by some people.
								<ul>
								<li>Concentration - The player must retain a sequence of action for a certain amount of time. Keep Focus.</li>
								<li>Management - The player must be able to organise a limited supply of scarce resources e.g. managing cool down time</li>
								<li>Memory - Player must memorise and retain important information for a long period of time</li>
								<li>Observation - Player must oversve an element that is part of the challenge</li>
								<li>Strategy - Before jumping into action, the player must make a decision based on limited information</li>
								<li>Tactics - The player must take the right decision and make the right decision by analysing obersvable information.</li>
								<li>Cleverness - The player must gather information and string together clues to find a solution to a problem</li>
								</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							</li>
						</p>
						<br><br>
						<li><p>
							<b>Difficulty progression of the player</b>
							<br><br>
							Difficulty of progression, is based on meeting new monsters in the overworld.
							Learning the methods and skills to beat them. Whilst quite linear, dungeons will have
							difficulty curves.

							To be clearer, your short term motivation OCR is the core gameplay loop that will become
							repetitive for your player.
							You must prototype this loop early during your conception process and massively iterate on
							it until it becomes frictionless and fun to play.
							When this is done and you succeed to prove the fun of it than you can move on to the next
							steps, find a medium term-motivation.
						</p></li>
						<li><p>
							<b>Mid term:</b>

							The midterm retention can also be defined as what will motivate the player to complete the
							current chapter, level or mission?
							<br><br>
							The midterm motivation loop must be clear and understandable by the player during the FTUE.
							Again, the time will differ depending on
							wether you work on AAA games or on mobile game. For the AAA games, the player can complete
							that midterm OCR loop within a 20 minutes timeframe.
							If you don’t succeed to give to the player a strong understanding and amazing experience of
							what will make them continue playing the game,
							there’s a big chance that you will lose that player forever.

							<b>Long term:</b>

							The long term retention is what motivates the player to finish and complete the game. What
							will make the player stay in the game for 30,
							60 days? What will make them complete the game? For free to play mobile games, we even talk
							about years from 1 to 5 years.
							Consider those aspect early during the design of the game. If you don’t have those features
							for free to play game, you succeed to
							retain your super fan and you will skip great user conversion opportunity.

							There are 2 types of player’s motivation, Extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation.

							Extrinsic motivation refers to a behaviour that is driven by external reward. In video game,
							you can compare it to any type of rewards that the player acquires in the game that will
							change is a way of playing.

							Extrinsic motivation comes from outside the player. They are generally rewards for a main
							character in the game.

							Intrinsic motivation is driven by internal rewards. It is a behavior that arises as an
							individual because it is naturally satisfying you.

							Intrinsic motivation comes from pleasure gets from tasks or activity itself. This motivation
							also comes from a sense of satisfaction in completing those tasks or activities.

							Personal benefits
							Pleasure of manipulation
							Flow
							Social interaction
							Recognition

							The BOTW rewards system contained:

							The global ECONOMIC system
							The COOKING system
							The Guardians ITEMS
							The spirits EMBLEM
							The ancient PORTRAITS
							The link HOUSE
							The FAIRY fountain
							The global ECONOMIC system allowed the player to customize the appeareance of the main
							character.
							It allowed the player to get better gears and be more efficient against enemies.
							It also allowed the player to buy, renovate and decorate their house.
						</p>
						<br><br>
						<li>
						<p>
							<b>The pacing of the game and the variety if the game.</b>
							<br><br>
							We already set that you must have a strong and fun core gameplay loop. 
							We also learn that you need a strong rewards system that will reward different type of players to do different type of actions. 
							If your game already have those 2 aspects, you are already having a strong design.

						<h3> Microflow </h3>
						<p>
							The microflow is emotionally intense. It is an experience that lasts for a short period of
							time but can repeat over time.
							If your gameplay loop doesn’t contain microflow element, there’s a big chance that your game
							will fail to get engage users.
							<br><br>
							HOW TO BUILD THE MICROFLOW

							There are 3 important means that you can integrate into your game design to help you create
							the
							microflow for your game.
							</p>

							<ul>
							<li>
							<p><b>
							Gameplay rythm
							</b>
							The gameplay rythm and the player inputs are related to a temp and a rythmic pattern.

							Design the player inputs combination as a rythmic pattern is part of work to create the microflow. 
							If there is no real define pattern in the player input experience, it will be harder for your game 
							to create the microflow effect for the player.
							</p>
							</li>
							<li>
							<p><b>
							The virtuous circle effect
							</b>
							This mechanic will help the player to be and to stay in the microflow. 
							As long as the player succeeds and stays in the flow, the challenge will become easier 
							and stays easier.
							</p>
							<div class="">
							<a href="assets/images/huddled.jpeg"><img class="figure-img img-fluid shadow rounded"
									src="assets/images/virtous_circle.jpeg" alt=""
									title="https://huddled.co.uk/2018/09/why-the-lake-district-is-the-place-to-visit-this-autumn/" /></a>
							</div>
							</li>
							<li>
							<p><b>
							Positive feedbacks and rewards
							</b>
							The more the player succeeds in doing a specific action, the more the game should give him positive 
							feedbacks to help to maintain him in the flow. In Candy Crush, the sugar crush sequence gives many 
							rewards and chaining success based on the player performance. The more the player succeed to complete the 
							puzzle in less move will make the sugar crush sequence more and more rewarding. Even so, if the level is 
							complete, the game maintains the player in the microflow and keep him still wanting to play.
							</p>
							</li>
							Design the player inputs combination as a rythmic pattern is part of work to create the
							microflow.
							If there is no real define pattern in the player input experience, it will be harder for
							your game
							to create the microflow effect for the player.

							This mechanic will help the player to be and to stay in the microflow.
							As long as the player succeeds and stays in the flow, the challenge will become easier and
							stays easier.
							POSITIVE FEEDBACKS AND REWARDS

							The more the player succeeds in doing a specific action, the more the game should give him
							positive
							feedbacks to help to maintain him in the flow. In Candy Crush, the sugar crush sequence
							gives many
							rewards and chaining success based on the player performance. The more the player succeed to
							complete
							the puzzle in less move will make the sugar crush sequence more and more rewarding. Even so,
							if the level
							is complete, the game maintains the player in the microflow and keep him still wanting to
							play.
							<br><br>
							Once the dungeon is over, the same basic sequence will happen, filling in a lot of the story
							of the area
							and giving the player a reason to continue their progression in the game (aka new item).
							Scaterred between the usual
							game flow conventions will be special "Set pieces", which will act as a buffer between two
							locations.

						<h3> Peblo </h3>
						<p>
							Peblo is a cultivation of year's worth of imagining.
							I wanted a character that grew along with whatever story the game had.
							He had to be hollow to start with, emotionless, talentless and realise his potential through
							tasks.
							<br><br>
							Peblo is the embodiment of that, a clay doll brought to life.

							This is the most important section for Peblo. Peblo's core gameplay loop, relys on

						<ul>
							<section class="docs-section" id="item-7-1">
							<li><p>
								<b>Movement:</b>
								<br><br>
								Peblo has 2 speeds, crouching and running. As peblo grows to become more whole, he gains new
								abilities. Crouching being one of them.
								Stamina will not play an effect in Peblo. I wan't the players to instead choose their
								movement type based on the surrounding areas. For example
								crouching for when hiding from a monster. True movement will be caused by using the
								umbrella.
							</p></li>
							</section>
							<section class="docs-section" id="item-7-2">
							<li><p>
								<b>Flying:</b>
								<br><br>
								Peblo can use his umbrella to fly. Because of his weight, Peblo drops quickly meaning
								prolonged gliding isnt available to the player. They must instead, determine the
								best angle to fly to e.g. a cliff edge
							</p></li>
							</section>
							<section class="docs-section" id="item-7-3">
							<li><p>
								<b>Swimming:</b>
								<br><br>
								Whilst peblo cannot swim because he's to heavy. He can float using the umbrella as a boat.
								Peblo is unable to steer the umbrella until
								he acquires a special item in the mid game.
							</p></li>

							<section class="docs-section" id="item-7-5">

								<b>Combat:</b>
								<br><br>
								The rate of combat depends on the method the player wishes to use to kill an enemy (if
								possible).
								Players can choose; environmental, fighting or running away.
								<br><br>
								In order to deal damage faster, the player should understand the attack pattern of the
								enemy, what it'
								weaknesses are.
								<br><br>
								When Peblo gets hit theres a brief period of invincilbity to allow the plaeyr to react.

							Enemies will react based on these two basic senses, sight and sound.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><p>
								<b>Sight</b> 
								<br><br>
								Enemies work on a radial system primarily. The closer, Peblo is to an enemy.
								The more likely he is to be found.
							</p></li>
							<li><p>
								<b>Sound</b> 
								<br><br>
								Enemies can hear sound. Peblo can limit his sound by reducing movement or crouching.
								This can help in stealth like kills.
