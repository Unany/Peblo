						    <p> 
							I have always loved the video games; it is quite easily one of the main contributors
							towards my extended admiration for developers. 
							<br><br>
							I first played the game when I was fourteen
							and continuously come back to the franchise year after year. The reason I chose to write about
							this game is not only because Silent Hill 2 is my favourite game of all time, but an academic
							reason to invest time in researching the game, far beyond my previous research. A lot of the
							content of this document is of course prior knowledge of the game, but a good proportion of
							information has been discovered through this project, allowing me to understand its
							development with increasing complexity. 
							<br><br>
							Two of the main compelling objects of the
							development I have allowed to bleed into this document, both of which were created before
							the original design document was realised. The first is the script, which I have thankfully not
							printed out as it would be far from the direction of the assignment. The second is the main
							theme for Silent Hill 2, composed again before the original design document was conceived. 
							<br><br>
							I have in this case provided that track on a CD; if only to authenticate some part of the original
							document through this reverse engineering. The original design document has not been
							published online, and I can only imagine that if it was, I would need a translator to decipher the
							Japanese text.
							<br><br>
							I hope you enjoy this document.

						<h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
						<p>
						Silent Hill 2 is a 3rd person experience for the Playstation 2 console. The protagonist is
						James Sunderland who is drawn to Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his dead wife Mary,
						asking him to meet her there.
						</p>
						<p>
						We have 8 seconds to capture someone's attention. Whilst you're reading this. Those second's have already gone.
						<br><br>
						That's why short and punchy descriptions are key. This is where the three point approach comes in. 
						If you head to the steam store page right now and click on a top seller. 
						The majority of the time it will have three sentences in it's description.
						<br><br>
						We need to give the consumer the gist of the game, an overview of the plot and the tonality.
						Below is Peblos:
						<br><br>
						<p><b>
						"If you could fight fate. Would you?
						Find out in this top-down action-adventure.
						Gather your courage and propogate the land with hope!""
						</b></p>
						</p>
					</section><!--//section-->
					<section class="docs-section" id="item-2-2">
						<h2 class="section-heading">Background</h2>
						<p>
						Silent Hill 2 will be a continuation of the franchise, a similar feel to the first game, with
						entirely new technical methods of implementation. Although the game will use a brand new
						custom engine, many core concepts from the Playstation predecessor will transposed into the
						new engine code. The reason behind this is the previous success of the Silent Hill engine, which
						allowed us to create an atmosphere truly unique for the franchise.
						Many of the previous team (Team Silent) will be working on this project with the
						exception of previous director Keiichiro Toyama.
						<br><br>
						For me the game's style has a lot to do with fond memories.
						I find the time's when nothing is happening, or i'm not forcing it are the times my inspiration comes.
						<br>
						<br>
						In the case of Peblo, I dreamt of an autumn scene, walking aross the british countryside.
						From that inspiration I scour the web (mainly pinterest) for images that allow me to daydream scenes.
						It's from this daydreaming that the rest of the pieces fall together.

						I then take the images and come up with a colour palette for the game.
						Personally, I use adobe colour wheel as it's free and allows for accompanying

						<br>
						<p>
						Lastly, I needed to ask myself "What type of textures do I like". 
						This was relatively easy for me, throughout my life i've adored studio ghilbi. 
						If you've played Peblo, you'll see that the art style partially mimics this.
						However, In order to do this we need to take into account several things.
						<br><br>
						1. It's a handpainted style
						<br>
						2. The textures are simple, not overcomplicated.
						<br>
						3. The textures are sometimes overlayed by another texture to create depth. E.G. Moss on a rock

						<h2 class="section-heading">Description</h2>	
						<p>
						Silent Hill 2 like the first game, places the player at the floor of the town with lots of
						questions and no answers. It is the players job to unravel the mystery of what happened to
						attract the protagonist to the town, be that killing lots of monsters, or avoiding as many fights
						as possible. The few things they cannot avoid are puzzles and the horrifying truth the game has
						to offer about the circumstances of your avatars arrival.
						<br><br>
						I wanted the world to be something personal, something which I have fond memories of, so that I can build the world with evocative emotion.
						<br><br>
						WHen I was younger I went on a camping trip to the lake district with my Dad and brother. 
						I fell in love with the lake district.
						Rich, fond emotions are always their when I think about itself.
						The decision was easy! Why not make the world out of the UK, the lake district behind the setting for Peblo.
						Now obviously we can't copy it 1 to 1. The scale of the world would be unmangeable for a 1 person scene, so I came up with a better idea.
						Trace the map of the lake district.

						This is a perfect stage to block out a basic world, where the rivers go, the mountains and any other features.
						Just remember the world WILL Change, don't spend ages doing it.

						<h2 class="section-heading">Key Features</h2>
						<p>
						Silent Hill:
						<br>
						Silent Hill 2 will allow players to explore more of the original games location,
						revealing new and disturbing areas.
						Compelling New Story:
						Silent Hill 2 will feature a brand new story set in the Silent Hill universe, with
						brand new characters, puzzles and monsters.
						Graphics:
						With all new graphics and real to life CG movies, Silent Hill 2 will really immerse
						players into the game, creating natural characters and breath taking environments. The game
						will really push for high cinematic quality in both game play and cut scenes.
						Dynamic Camera Angles:
						Silent Hill 2 will use periodically fixed camera angles to intensify the game play,
						similar to the first game. This adds to the cinematic approach the game will take.
						Sound:
						The game will contain a completely new soundtrack composed by Akira Yamaoka
						who created the soundtrack for the first game. The game will also use S-Force technology to
						create a more immersive sound.
						Difficulty:
						The difficulty for Silent Hill 2 will be set in 2 categories. Riddle level and Enemy
						level. You can set the level respectively for each individually, using a 3 tier method.
						</p>
						<p>
						Peblo is a cultivation of year's worth of imagining.
						I wanted a character that grew along with whatever story the game had.
						He had to be hollow to start with, emotionless, talentless and realise his potential through tasks.
						<br><br>
						Peblo is the embodiment of that, a clay doll brought to life. 
						<br><br>
						Below are some iterations of Peblo, made in adobe illustrator.

						<h2 class="section-heading">Genre</h2>
						<p>
						Silent Hill 2 like its predecessor falls neatly somewhere between survival horror and
						psychological horror, though unlike the previous game, the psychological horror in Silent Hill 2
						will be more apparent. This is due to the story having a more direct approach, and a more
						explicit subject matter.

						<p>
						1.Why i didnt want to plan the story to start with
						2.Minimum story
						I'm not a natural writer.
						I come up with plot's in my head, but developign it and world-building I struggle with.
						Therefore, it's easier for me to develop the art, world and characters before I make the story.
						My process is as follows:
						<br><br>
						1. Have a moment of inspiration
						<br>
						2. Explain it to my girlfriend to see if she likes it as a non-gamer
						<br>
						3. Look for art inspiration online, that matches what I want to do (I'm not artistic, so its either this or stick figures!)
						<br>
						4. Develop my world
						<br>
						5. Develop my characters
						<br>
						6. The story then just comes to me

						<h2 class="section-heading">Core Game Play</h2>
						<p>
						The core game play in “Silent Hill 2” will be a mix of both fighting “monsters” and solving
						puzzles, both of which serve your progress in the game.
						Fighting – The fighting in “Silent Hill 2” will be based much around its survival horror
						counterpart “Resident Evil”. What will set the combat apart from our counterparts is the overall
						style and pace of the game. Unlike the previous game and much of the “Resident Evil” series,
						players will be more inclined to avoid battles entirely because of the disturbing nature of their
						design and sound. A slew of enemies will be roaming the streets, including back alleys and
						hidden under cars. When it comes to interior exploration, enemies will be dotted around
						corridors and rooms, but sparsely enough to maintain the feeling of isolation and fear. The
						game works heavily on the concept that what you don’t see, makes you increasingly scared. An
						example of this would be to have a long dark corridor with nothing but doors to explore. The
						player cannot see to the other end of the corridor, creating the fear that something is at the
						end of the corridor, making the player move apprehensively to the other end. A possible way to
						describe the combat in “Silent Hill 2” is to compare it to other survival horror games. For
						example, in survival games such as Resident Evil, you will walk down a corridor with a sick
						feeling in your stomach, and then all of a sudden a dog will jump out and attack you. You can
						kill the dog and end the threat until more enemies come along, usually a horde of zombies.
						In Silent Hill, you will walk down a corridor with a sick feeling in your stomach, and
						nothing will happen, the threat doesn’t start and it never ends. Killing one nurse in a somewhat
						abandoned hospital is not enough to know you’re safe. The fixed camera angles that were a
						core characteristic of the first game will return, to help intensify this feeling of isolation and
						apprehension. The two main ways of detecting these monsters will be a flashlight for visual
						detection, and a radio that emits static when a monster is nearby. Both these methods allow
						the player to be warned of danger, but the sensory perception of the monsters mean that
						danger is most certainly on its way. Incidentally, if James leaves his flashlight off in dark areas,
						the screen will increasingly gain brightness, imitating the effect that his eyes are getting used to
						the dark.
						Puzzles – The Puzzles in “Silent Hill 2” will truly attempt to break usual puzzle solving
						conventions in the genre. Opposed to the usual puzzle solving which would remove you from

						Oliver James Cooke 09000916

						12
						the immersion of the world, the intention here is to incorporate the necessary “pieces of the
						puzzle” into the narrative. Instead of the cliché “there is a hole here for a crest, go and find it”.
						The style of the puzzles in “Silent Hill 2” will defiantly reflect the atmosphere and underlying
						narrative of the game. The audience is promoted to think hard about the solutions, giving the
						players neither the task of collection, nor the tactic of try every combination. This method was
						incorporated in the first Silent Hill at heart. The puzzles could be cracked via trial and error, but
						the iconography surrounding the puzzle made it increasingly disturbing.

						<h2 class="section-heading">Game Flow</h2>
						<p>
						Typical game flow in “Silent Hill 2” will be normally quite linear. Players will be given a
						portion of the narrative, then be given a reason in that narrative to explore a certain section of
						the town, which will be usually an indoor section (levels). On entering the section, they will
						encounter 3 things consistently,
						- Enemies
						- A puzzle or puzzles
						- Multiple narrative sections, with one or two intense plot progression scenes
						Once the “level” is over, the same basic sequence will happen, filling in a lot of the story
						and giving the player a reason to continue their progression through the game. Scattered
						between the usual game flow conventions will be special “set pieces”, which will act as a buffer
						between two locations in the game, and will mostly house a cut scene, fleshing out characters
						or plot.

						The flashlight helps James see in the dark, helping him to see important items and

						flashlight, the radio can also draw attention to James. The radio does not work for normal

						<h2 class="section-heading">Game Physics & Statistics</h2>
						<p>
						Movement – James has 3 primary speeds, walk, jog and run. The player can primarily
						walk anywhere at a set pace, the act of walking long distances will not take an effect on the
						avatar. The next two speeds jog and run, are determined by how “tired” James is, this will
						usually be calculated by how long James has been running consistently. If James runs for a long
						distance it will eventually slow into a jog, after a period of jogging James will then burst into
						running until “tired” again. This cool down time can be reduced by walking as opposed to
						jogging. The tactic of running then stopping just before James gets tired, then bursting into
						another lengthy run, will be abolished and will be calculated on how much running James has
						done on average. These 3 speeds can be further altered by being injured. Having James’ health
						drop below a certain threshold will reduce the speed of usual movement. James is also able to
						sidestep to the left and right, as well as perform a 180 degree turn.
						<br><br>
						Combat – The rate of combat depends on which weapon the player decided to arm
						James with some close combat weapons will take longer to strike, but will inherently deal more
						damage. This idea can be easily transposed to firearms by allowing the better weapons to deal
						more damage, but taking longer to reload, leaving the avatar prone to attacks. When enemies
						get attacked, they react to the damage depending on their current health. This can mean they
						will either be stopped from moving, get pushed back or fall to the floor. When James gets hit,
						there is a brief moment after that the player becomes prone to extra attacks and cannot
						defend, just as if someone was pushed over in real life. James also has the ability to coup de
						grace enemies that are in a prone position; he accomplishes this by stamping on them.

						<h2 class="section-heading">Artificial Intelligence</h2>
						<p>
						The enemies in the game will react with two basic senses, sight and sound. These two
						senses will give the AI an impression of carnal attacks. Unlike the “Resident Evil” series in which
						the zombies attack with a need to feed, the monsters in “Silent Hill 2” attack with nothing more
						than basic instinct.
						Sight – Enemies work on a radial system primarily. The basic theory is, if James gets too
						close to the enemy, the enemy will advance with intent to harm. Some enemies when hit to the
						floor, will have the ability to crawl away from James at a fast pace, exiting the players sight
						from the screen. This is used as a general regrouping mechanism for the enemies, in which they
						then have time to stand up and perform better attacks, as opposed to attacking from the floor.
						In places of darkness, the radial system is dependent on the flashlight James carries. If the

						Oliver James Cooke 09000916

						26
						flashlight is turned off then the enemy radius is dramatically reduced and will only attack if the
						player near enough bumps into the enemy.
						Sound – Enemies can also base attacks from the sounds they hear. The sound of
						footsteps and the radio which James carries, act as a beacon for enemies. In turn the enemies
						will advance to the source of the noise and attack James. Enemies will not hear the footsteps of
						James while walking.
						The only time these two rules do not apply to the enemies AI is if there is a specific “set
						piece”, in which the enemy is scripted to act in a certain way.

						<h2 class="section-heading">Overall Goals</h2>
						<p>
						Artistic style was a true staple for the previous game, Silent Hill 2 will intend to bring the
						same motifs of the first game with unbelievable vibrancy and character, into this generation of
						consoles. The true artistic goal of this project is based on a concept of simultaneous repulsion
						and attraction, to define their impact to the player. Interior environments will look abandoned
						and disgusting, but at the same time will have a distinct charm. Almost like grim visual
						backgrounds and set pieces will have an aura of mystery about them. The exterior
						environments will be treated differently. The town will be given a true sense of isolation by lack
						of interactivity, making the town seem bigger that it really is. One key sequence intended for
						implementation is the extended walk to the town of Silent Hill. We intentionally want this
						sequence to be long, as to give the player a true feeling that the town is isolated and soon you
						will be. Additionally the game will have a grainy filter for the entirety of the game, to dirty the
						images and give them character. In addition, various artistic decisions placed around the game
						will give the player subliminal help with understanding the story. One idea of which is finding a
						person dead slumped in a chair, the exact character model will be of the main character James,
						but the art direction of the body will make it only slightly distinguishable as your character. All
						of these visual elements will aid each other to convey a mysterious feeling of solitude and
						isolation, which is the true nature of the game.
						The monsters in the game will also adopt this method of simultaneous repulsion and
						attraction. The monsters are not extremely abstract from human anatomy, giving the player a
						fear of relation to the very things they are scared of or even kill. Hits of sexuality will be
						intentionally placed in the art direction, making the nurse’s clothes rather short, and the
						mannequins legs silky smooth. These intentional decisions are implemented to heighten the
						male insinuation of the pyramid head monster, a male slaughtering and suggestively
						sodomizing the female related monsters.
						The human characters will take on a mundane approach on purpose. None of them are
						meant to be super heroes and imperfections are needed to appreciate the fragility of the lives
						at stake. All of the characters except Laura have skin imperfections and extremely normal
						clothes. Incidentally the same face is used for both Mary and Maria, further strengthening their
						roles in the story.

						The beginning of the game introduces James Sunderland, the main character and
						avatar of the player. The game starts with James on the cusp of Silent Hill, standing on the
						observation deck overlooking Toluca Lake. James has travelled to Silent Hill after receiving a
						letter from his wife Mary, who had apparently died from an illness 3 years prior to James’
						return to the town. The letter James possesses states that Mary is waiting for him in their
						“special place”. This somewhat confuses James, as the whole town itself could be seen as their
						“special place”. James considers that the park by the lake could be the location the letter
						mentions, and decides to leave the observation deck and head to town.

						“Leave” Ending
						At the top of the metal steps James finds what he assumes to be Mary, but is in fact
						Maria in Mary’s clothes. James tells Maria that he doesn’t need her anymore, but Maria intends
						to take James down with her. Maria transforms into a monster and James kills her. After Maria
						is dead, the scene changes to James at Mary’s bed. James asks Mary for forgiveness, stating
						that his reason for killing her was because he wanted his life back and he hated her. Mary
						forgives him in the sense that she asks him to do one last thing for her, and go on with his life.
						Mary hands James a letter and she passes away.
						Mary’s letter is read aloud and in full as opposed to the section James reads at the
						beginning of the game. After, James and Laura are seen at the graveyard where James met
						Angela, and they leave Silent Hill together. It is insinuated that James fulfilled Marys wishes and
						adopted Laura.

						<h2 class="section-heading">Target Market</h2>
						<p>
						Silent Hill will be developed for the Playstation 2. This platform was chosen as it has a
						huge install base, which will enable to game to receive a wide reception of audiences. The
						Playstation platform has proven to be the stable ground for the mature style of game. Silent Hill
						released on the Playstation as well as the Resident Evil series, which did extremely well.
						Continuing previous success, we believe the same consumers of these titles will have converted
						to the upgraded Playstation 2 hardware, thus the install base denotes our market within that
						platform. Although sales show the first Silent Hill game did not create as much hype or profit as
						the Resident Evil series, numerous publishing bodies congratulated the game as being
						extremely innovative. We intend to further attract the niche audience our first game created
						and expand beyond that, enticing new players to enjoy the psychological horror. These new
						players will be placed in the 13 to 25 age range, we chose this as younger players will revel in
						the combat and gore aspect, while older players will get more enjoyment from the story and
						the puzzles. Typically the game will aim at a male audience, though the standard of the art
						direction could considerably influence a female audience.

						Silent Hill 2 will be the first big release for the genre on a new operating platform. We
						can see other titles prom the previous generation which proves the genre is strong. Such titles
						like Clock Tower reinvented the genre by changing the pace of combat, making is truly about
						surviving the horror as opposed to shooting everything. Clock Tower went on to split audiences,
						until it too, created their niche audience. The Resident Evil series, though extremely differently
						paced to Silent Hill, delivered the classic survival horror experience. Multiple encounters,
						sudden exhilarating rushes and fantastic art design. It is this pattern which will allow Silent Hill 2
						to be a success for not only the platform but the genre. Silent Hill 2 will bring its distinctive style
						to the table of the next generation, and hopefully broaden the genre for years to come.

						<h2 class="section-heading">Feature Comparison</h2>
						<p>
						The main comparison for Silent Hill 2 from previous games will be the obvious graphical
						leap. The story will harness the power of the platform to deliver stunning visuals and
						unprecedented emotional involvement. The sound quality will be a major improvement and so
						will the resolution our game will be playable in. Models and textures will be substantially
						clearer, with a better capability to encapsulate more on screen at once. The vibration function
						of the Playstation 2 controller will also add numerous enhancements to the game play
						experience. Silent Hill 2 will continue its predecessor’s staple on the market, reinventing
						psychological horror through a level of storytelling maturity not seen in the genre.
