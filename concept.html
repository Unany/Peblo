						    <p>
							I've always wanted to make my own video game, a world I could call my own, characters that relate to my own life.
							<br><br>
							Growing up with an engineering father, my gameboy and an vivid imagination, were all contributers in creating the man I am today.
							It's fuelled my passion of game development, my constant fascination with indie developers and reared me into a world of game dev.
							<br><br>
							My background was never in game development, whilst I grew up playing games, I never thought of the prospect
							of game development until I was in my third of university.
							<br><br>
							I studied Geology, a far cry from anything software related. For some reason it never clicked. 
							I never felt any passion from my degree but I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life.
							<br><br>
							That's when I started to code. What felt like a chore at the start, turned into something I actively spent all my
							free time on. I enjoyed solving problems, developing solutions that were both efficient and thorough. I've worked on
							drones, to home automation, through to my own personal projects all in C#. I pushed through the Mt Stupid, of the
							Dunning-Krugger effect and whilst I don't consider myself the best software programmer of all time, I know enough
							to implement solutions on a myriad of tasks.
							<br><br>
							This document is an ode to Peblo and myself, showing the journey from conception to creation.
							A cumilation of my present and past, which I hope you see portraid in my art.
							<br><br>
							I hope you enjoy this document.

					<section class="docs-section" id="item-2-1">
						<h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
						<p>
						If you could fight fate? Would you?
						<br><br>
						Peblo is a Top-Down action-adventure game for the PC with the intent to launch on the nintendo switch.
						Peblo was a clay doll created by Eva, brought to life to fufill his fate by a 'god'.
						</p>
					</section><!--//section-->
					<section class="docs-section" id="item-2-2">
						<h2 class="section-heading">Background</h2>
						<p>
						Peblo will aim to be a franchise, exploring the relationship between Eva and Peblo and what fate has in store for them.
						The game will be built using Unity and its scriptable rendering pipeline URP.
						<br><br>
						As it's a new game, with a lot of technical methods to implement, in order to make the game achievable
						the top-done engine asset by More Mountains is being used as the core.
						<br><br>
						Having been developed for years, with good documentation - it is the perfect based to start developing a top-down game.
						I will then add additional fucntionality on top of information. 
						<br><br>
						A lot of the core concepts will be brough across from the Legend of Zelda series but changed in order to
						make it more original and unique than that franchise.
					</section><!--//section-->
					<section class="docs-section" id="item-2-3">
						<h2 class="section-heading">Description</h2>	
						<p>
						Peblo, places the player in an unknown world, with no direction and questions without answers.
						<br><br>
						It is the players job to unravel what their fate is, why they were brought to life and what the
						voices are, be that helping others are letting others sucumb to their fate.
						<br><br>
						The few things the player can avoid is their own impending fate and the truth of Peblo's creation.
						</p>
					</section><!--//section-->
					<section class="docs-section" id="item-2-4">
						<h2 class="section-heading">Key Features</h2>
						<p>
						Peblo will allow the player to explore the fragmented world, and piece together what happened. From an empty shell, to a full vessel,
						I hope that the player can experience who peblo is and find comfort in the fact that we all carry a seed of change.
						<br><br>
						I really want the Peblo world to feel rich and alive, its a perfect contrast to something which is so empty to start with.
						In order to achieve this, I want to really use physics to make every second in the game feel impactful.
						From Dynamic Water, to vivid vegetation and players interaction with the environment. It should feel special.
						<br><br>
						A dynamic story will allow for playability. Each character has several fates, some fixed, some changeable.
						This leads to different endings.
						<br><br>
						Peblo will have two difficulties. This is to ensure, extra challenges to veteran gamers, whilst newer gamers
						can pick up the game with ease.
						</p>
						<br>
					</section><!--//section-->
					<section class="docs-section" id="item-2-5">
						<h2 class="section-heading">Genre</h2>
						<p>
						Peblo is a Third-person action-adventure game. Closely, following the genre of the Legend of Zelda series.
						</p>			
					</section><!--//section-->
					<section class="docs-section" id="item-2-6">
						<h2 class="section-heading">Platform</h2>
						<p>
						The targeted platform is the Nintendo Switch, with the game being built for PC and then ported across.
						I want the nintendo switch to be the primary platform.
						</p>

					    <section class="docs-section" id="item-3-1">
						<h2 class="section-heading">Core Game Play</h2>
						<p>
						The core game play in Peblo will be a mix of puzzle solving and fighting monsters,
						both of which serve your progress in the game.
						<br><br>
						Fighting - The fighting in Peblo, will be slow and precise. Rather then button mashing,
						Peblo should be precise and smart in defeating enemies. This means utilising his surroundings
						and umbrella in order to destroy the enemies. 
						<br><br>
						I want players to pick their fights, rather then be inclined to fight every monsters.
						They should make a calculated decision, and weigh up whether its worth it.
						<br><br>
						Puzzles – The Puzzles in Peblo, will be difficult. I want a game which truly causes you to think,
						kind of like a dark souls of puzzles. Rather then being spoon fed the answer, players should feel
						very rewarded for coming up with a solution.
						<br><br>
						That is why its crucial that every puzzle is solvable from the get go, with a variety of solutions.
						<br><br>
						Its crucial to make the world itself a puzzle, the story of the world should be a puzzle in itself.
						Being solved by the narrative and by the puzzles within the game. Solving the puzzle of the world,
						will lead you to the end game. Rather then following a sequential pattern.
						</p>	
						</section>

						<section class="docs-section" id="item-3-2">
						<h2 class="section-heading">Game Flow</h2>
						<p>
							Typical game flow in Peblo, will be linear. Players will be given a portion of the narrative, then be given a reason 
							in that narrative to explore a certain section of the town, which will be usually an indoor section (dungeon). On entering an area
							they will encounter 3 things consitently,
							<br><br>
							- Enemies
							<br>
							- A puzzle or puzzles#
							<br>
							- Multiple narrative sections, with one or two intense plot progression scenes
							<br><br>
							Once the dungeon is over, the same basic sequence will happen, filling in a lot of the story of the area
							and giving the player a reason to continue their progression in the game (aka new item). Scaterred between the usual
							game flow conventions will be special "Set pieces", which will act as a buffer between two locations.
						</p>		
						</section>

						<section class="docs-section" id="item-3-3">
						<h2 class="section-heading">Characters</h2>	
						<p>
						Peblo is a cultivation of year's worth of imagining.
						I wanted a character that grew along with whatever story the game had.
						He had to be hollow to start with, emotionless, talentless and realise his potential through tasks.
						<br><br>
						Peblo is the embodiment of that, a clay doll brought to life. 
						<br><br>
						Below are some iterations of Peblo, made in adobe illustrator.

						Flashlight & radio
						<br><br>
						The flashlight helps James see in the dark, helping him to see important items and
						monsters. Equally having the flashlight on makes James easier to be spotted by danger. The
						radio helps James detect nearby enemies, emitting a loud static when danger is nearby. Like the
						flashlight, the radio can also draw attention to James. The radio does not work for normal
						transmissions.

							Umbrella
							<br><br>
							The umbrella is a multi-purpose tool in Peblo. It can help him fight enemies, reflect projectiles, float, fly and pole vault.
							
						</p>	
						<p>
							World Seed
							<br><br>
							The world seed is a tool to help guide the player in the game, it acts as a spiritual guide.
							The player doesn't know what it does, except for the fact it grows bigger whilst reaching certain points in the story.
							<br><br>
							In actual fact its peblo's fate to become a sacrifical pawn for fate, and the world seed is just a tool at play.

						<h2 class="section-heading">Game Physics & Statistics</h2>
						<p>
							This is the most important section for Peblo. Peblo's core gameplay loop, relys on
							physics to make a dynamic and changing world. 
							<br><br>
							Movement:
							<br><br>
							Peblo has 2 speeds, crouching and running. As peblo grows to become more whole, he gains new abilities. Crouching being one of them.
							Stamina will not play an effect in Peblo. I wan't the players to instead choose their movement type based on the surrounding areas. For example
							crouching for when hiding from a monster. True movement will be caused by using the umbrella.
							<br><br>
							Flying:
							<br><br>
							Peblo can use his umbrella to fly. Because of his weight, Peblo drops quickly meaning prolonged gliding isnt available to the player. They must instead, determine the
							best angle to fly to e.g. a cliff edge
							<br><br>
							Swimming:
							<br><br>
							Whilst peblo cannot swim because he's to heavy. He can float using the umbrella as a boat. Peblo is unable to steer the umbrella until
							he acquires a special item in the mid game.

							Combat:
							<br><br>
							The rate of combat depends on the method the player wishes to use to kill an enemy (if possible).
							Players can choose; environmental, fighting or running away.
							<br><br>
							In order to deal damage faster, the player should understand the attack pattern of the enemy, what it'
							weaknesses are.
							<br><br>
							When Peblo gets hit theres a brief period of invincilbity to allow the plaeyr to react.

							Enemies will react based on these two basic senses, sight and sound.
							<br><br>
							Sight - enemies work on a radial system primarily. The closer, Peblo is to an enemy.

							Sound - enemies can hear sound. Peblo can limit his sound by reducing movement or crouching.

						<h2 class="section-heading">Overall Goals</h2>
						<p>
						Artistic style was a true staple for the previous game, Silent Hill 2 will intend to bring the
						same motifs of the first game with unbelievable vibrancy and character, into this generation of
						consoles. The true artistic goal of this project is based on a concept of simultaneous repulsion
						and attraction, to define their impact to the player. Interior environments will look abandoned
						and disgusting, but at the same time will have a distinct charm. Almost like grim visual
						backgrounds and set pieces will have an aura of mystery about them. The exterior
						environments will be treated differently. The town will be given a true sense of isolation by lack
						of interactivity, making the town seem bigger that it really is. One key sequence intended for
						implementation is the extended walk to the town of Silent Hill. We intentionally want this
						sequence to be long, as to give the player a true feeling that the town is isolated and soon you
						will be. Additionally the game will have a grainy filter for the entirety of the game, to dirty the
						images and give them character. In addition, various artistic decisions placed around the game
						will give the player subliminal help with understanding the story. One idea of which is finding a
						person dead slumped in a chair, the exact character model will be of the main character James,
						but the art direction of the body will make it only slightly distinguishable as your character. All
						of these visual elements will aid each other to convey a mysterious feeling of solitude and
						isolation, which is the true nature of the game.
						The monsters in the game will also adopt this method of simultaneous repulsion and
						attraction. The monsters are not extremely abstract from human anatomy, giving the player a
						fear of relation to the very things they are scared of or even kill. Hits of sexuality will be
						intentionally placed in the art direction, making the nurse’s clothes rather short, and the
						mannequins legs silky smooth. These intentional decisions are implemented to heighten the
						male insinuation of the pyramid head monster, a male slaughtering and suggestively
						sodomizing the female related monsters.
						The human characters will take on a mundane approach on purpose. None of them are
						meant to be super heroes and imperfections are needed to appreciate the fragility of the lives
						at stake. All of the characters except Laura have skin imperfections and extremely normal
						clothes. Incidentally the same face is used for both Mary and Maria, further strengthening their
						roles in the story.

						For me the game's style has a lot to do with fond memories.
						I find the time's when nothing is happening, or i'm not forcing it are the times my inspiration comes.
						<br>
						<br>
						In the case of Peblo, I dreamt of an autumn scene, walking aross the british countryside.
						From that inspiration I scour the web (mainly pinterest) for images that allow me to daydream scenes.
						It's from this daydreaming that the rest of the pieces fall together.

						<p>
						Lastly, I needed to ask myself "What type of textures do I like". 
						This was relatively easy for me, throughout my life i've adored studio ghilbi. 
						If you've played Peblo, you'll see that the art style partially mimics this.
						However, In order to do this we need to take into account several things.
						<br><br>
						1. It's a handpainted style
						<br>
						2. The textures are simple, not overcomplicated.
						<br>
						3. The textures are sometimes overlayed by another texture to create depth. E.G. Moss on a rock

						Just like art, I'm inept at music.
						That's a huge problem in a video game as a good soundtrack can make or break a game.
						Luckily technology has come leaps and bounds and AI generated music is available from companys such as "AIVA".jpeg
						<br><br>
						I use AIVA for all my concept music.
						If I had a budget for music in my game, I would definitely consider music to be one of the most important elements to invest in.
						But because i'm an indie dev with no budget, I compromised with AI generated music.

						<p>
						The beginning of the game introduces James Sunderland, the main character and
						avatar of the player. The game starts with James on the cusp of Silent Hill, standing on the
						observation deck overlooking Toluca Lake. James has travelled to Silent Hill after receiving a
						letter from his wife Mary, who had apparently died from an illness 3 years prior to James’
						return to the town. The letter James possesses states that Mary is waiting for him in their
						“special place”. This somewhat confuses James, as the whole town itself could be seen as their
						“special place”. James considers that the park by the lake could be the location the letter
						mentions, and decides to leave the observation deck and head to town.

						“Leave” Ending
						At the top of the metal steps James finds what he assumes to be Mary, but is in fact
						Maria in Mary’s clothes. James tells Maria that he doesn’t need her anymore, but Maria intends
						to take James down with her. Maria transforms into a monster and James kills her. After Maria
						is dead, the scene changes to James at Mary’s bed. James asks Mary for forgiveness, stating
						that his reason for killing her was because he wanted his life back and he hated her. Mary
						forgives him in the sense that she asks him to do one last thing for her, and go on with his life.
						Mary hands James a letter and she passes away.
						Mary’s letter is read aloud and in full as opposed to the section James reads at the
						beginning of the game. After, James and Laura are seen at the graveyard where James met
						Angela, and they leave Silent Hill together. It is insinuated that James fulfilled Marys wishes and
						adopted Laura.

						I wanted the world to be something personal, something which I have fond memories of, so that I can build the world with evocative emotion.
						<br><br>
						WHen I was younger I went on a camping trip to the lake district with my Dad and brother. 
						I fell in love with the lake district.
						Rich, fond emotions are always their when I think about itself.
						The decision was easy! Why not make the world out of the UK, the lake district behind the setting for Peblo.
						Now obviously we can't copy it 1 to 1. The scale of the world would be unmangeable for a 1 person scene, so I came up with a better idea.
						Trace the map of the lake district.

						Clock Puzzle (Woodside Apartments - room 204)
						On a wall opposite a clock there is a carving in the wall with three names, Henry,

						is a document close by which has this information.
						Easy – “Three different sizes, time on the run. Three young men circlin' round the sun.
						Henry is short and very, very slow, Scott can't stop, he's always on the go.”
						Normal and above – “Three needles stand of three different heights. The fat, the tall
						and the thin. From slow to fast they move to the right. Scott rests not on three, but fifteen”
						The solution is the same for both difficulties. The names depict time, Henry = Hour,
						Mildred = Minutes and Scott = Seconds. The player has to move the needles on the clock to
						match the line directions associated to the name.

						Silent Hill will be developed for the Playstation 2. This platform was chosen as it has a
						huge install base, which will enable to game to receive a wide reception of audiences. The
						Playstation platform has proven to be the stable ground for the mature style of game. Silent Hill
						released on the Playstation as well as the Resident Evil series, which did extremely well.
						Continuing previous success, we believe the same consumers of these titles will have converted
						to the upgraded Playstation 2 hardware, thus the install base denotes our market within that
						platform. Although sales show the first Silent Hill game did not create as much hype or profit as
						the Resident Evil series, numerous publishing bodies congratulated the game as being
						extremely innovative. We intend to further attract the niche audience our first game created
						and expand beyond that, enticing new players to enjoy the psychological horror. These new
						players will be placed in the 13 to 25 age range, we chose this as younger players will revel in
						the combat and gore aspect, while older players will get more enjoyment from the story and
						the puzzles. Typically the game will aim at a male audience, though the standard of the art
						direction could considerably influence a female audience.

						<p>
						Silent Hill 2 will be the first big release for the genre on a new operating platform. We
						can see other titles prom the previous generation which proves the genre is strong. Such titles
						like Clock Tower reinvented the genre by changing the pace of combat, making is truly about
						surviving the horror as opposed to shooting everything. Clock Tower went on to split audiences,
						until it too, created their niche audience. The Resident Evil series, though extremely differently
						paced to Silent Hill, delivered the classic survival horror experience. Multiple encounters,
						sudden exhilarating rushes and fantastic art design. It is this pattern which will allow Silent Hill 2
						to be a success for not only the platform but the genre. Silent Hill 2 will bring its distinctive style
						to the table of the next generation, and hopefully broaden the genre for years to come.

						<p>
						The main comparison for Silent Hill 2 from previous games will be the obvious graphical
						leap. The story will harness the power of the platform to deliver stunning visuals and
						unprecedented emotional involvement. The sound quality will be a major improvement and so
						will the resolution our game will be playable in. Models and textures will be substantially
						clearer, with a better capability to encapsulate more on screen at once. The vibration function
						of the Playstation 2 controller will also add numerous enhancements to the game play
						experience. Silent Hill 2 will continue its predecessor’s staple on the market, reinventing
						psychological horror through a level of storytelling maturity not seen in the genre.
